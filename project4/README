Project 4 

A simple webcrawler that crawls 'Fakebook' located at fring.ccs.neu.edu. Logs in using supplied credentials and searched iteratively for 'secret flags' hidden in <h2> tags. The script handles 200, 303, 304, 404 and 500 response codes and will automatically reconnect to the server in the event an error occurs or the connection is terminated.
